<p><strong>♬ 1.	"Another Day of Sun"	La La Land Cast	3:48</strong></p>
<p>I think about that day<br>

I left him at a Greyhound station<br>

West of Sante Fe<br>

We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true<br>

Still I did what I had to do<br>

'Cuz I just knew<br>

Summer Sunday nights<br>

We'd sink into our seats<br>

Right as they dimmed out all the lights<br>

The Technicolor world made out of music and machine<br>

It called me to be on that screen<br>

And live inside its sheen<br>

Without a nickel to my name<br>

Hopped a bus, here I came<br>

Could be brave or just insane<br>

We'll have to see<br>

'Cuz maybe in that sleepy town<br>

He'll sit one day, the lights are down<br>

He'll see my face and think of how he used to know me<br>

Climb these hills I'm reaching for the heights<br>

And chasing all the lights that shine<br>

And when they let you down<br>

You'll get up off the ground<br>

As morning rolls around<br>

And it's another day of sun<br>

I hear them everyday<br>

The rhythms in the canyons that will never fade away<br>

The ballads in the ballrooms left by those who came before<br>

They say we got to want it more<br>

So I bang on every door<br>

And even when the answer's no<br>

Or when my money's running low<br>

The disc and mic and neon glow are all I need<br>

And some day as I sing the song<br>

A small-town kid will come along<br>

That'll be the thing to push him on and he'll go<br>

Climb these hills I'm reaching for the heights<br>

And chasing all the lights that shine<br>

And when they let you down<br>

You'll get up off the ground<br>

As morning rolls around<br>

And it's another day of sun<br>

When they let you down<br>

The morning rolls around<br>

It's another day of sun<br>

It's another day of sun<br>

It's another day of sun<br>

It's another day of sun<br>

Just another day of sun<br>

It's another day of sun<br>

The day has just begun<br>

It's another day of sun<br>

It's another day of sun </p>

<p>You got the invitation, you got the right address<br>

You need some medication, the answer's always yes<br>

A little chance encounter could be the one you've waited for<br>

Just squeeze a bit more<br>

Tonight we're on a mission, tonight's the casting call<br>

This is the real audition, oh God help us all<br>

You make the right impression then everybody knows your name<br>

We're in the fast lane<br>

Someone in the crowd could be the one you need to know<br>

The one to finally lift you off the ground<br>

Someone in the crowd could take you where you want to go<br>

If you're the someone ready to be found<br>

The someone ready to be found<br>

To make need to do<br>

Till they discover you<br>

And make you more than who<br>

You see now<br>

So let the stars align<br>

I think I'll stay behind<br>

You've got to go and find<br>

That someone in the crowd<br>

That someone in the crowd<br>

Is someone in the crowd<br>

The only thing your really see?<br>

Watching while the world<br>

Keeps spinning round<br>

Somewhere there's a place<br>

Where I find who I'm gonna be<br>

Somewhere that's just waiting<br>

to be found<br>

Someone in the crowd<br>

Could be the one you need to know<br>

That someone who could lift you<br>

Off the ground<br>

Someone in the crowd<br>

Will take you where you want to go<br>

Someone in the crowd will make you<br>

Someone in the crowd will take you<br>

Flying off the ground<br>

if you're the someone<br>

Ready to be found<br></p>

<p style="margin-top:50px;"><strong>♬ 4.	"A Lovely Night"	Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone	3:57</strong></p>
<p>The sun is nearly gone<br>
No lights are turning on<br>
A silver shine that stretches to the sea<br>

We stumble on a view<br>
That's tailor made for two<br>
What a shame those two are you and me<br>
Some other girl and guy<br>
Would love the swirling sky<br>
But there's only you and I<br>
And we've got, no shot<br>
This could never be<br>
You're not the type for me<br>

Really?<br>

And there's not a spark in sight<br>
What a, a waste of a lovely night<br>

You say there's nothing here<br>
Well let's make something clear<br>
I think I'll be the one to make that call<br>

what's your call<br>

I know you looked so cute<br>
In your polyester suit<br>

It's wool<br>

You're right I'd never fall for you at all<br>
And maybe this appeals<br>
To someone not in heels<br>
Or to any girl who feels<br>
There's some chance<br>
For romance<br>
But, I'm frankly feeling nothing<br>

Is that so?<br>

Or it could be less than nothing<br>

Good to know<br>
So you agree?<br>

That's right<br>

What a waste of a lovely night<br></p>

<p>City of stars<br>
Are you shining just for me?<br>
City of stars<br>
There's so much that I can't see<br>
Who knows<br>
Is this the start of something <br>
wonderful and new?<br>
Or one more dream <br>
that I cannot make true<br></p>

<p>City of stars,<br>
Are you shining just for me?<br>
City of stars,<br>
There's so much that i can't see.<br>
Who knows<br>
I felt it from the first embrace<br>
I shared with you.<br>
That now, Our dreams,<br>
They've finally come true.<br>

City of stars,<br>
Just one thing everybody wants.<br>
There in the bars<br>
and through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants.<br>

It's love<br>
Yes, all we're looking for<br>
is love from someone else<br>

A rush<br>
A glance<br>
A touch<br>
A dance<br>

To look in somebody's eyes,<br>
To light up the skies,<br>
To open the world and send me reeling,<br>
A voice that says i'll be here <br>
and you'll be alright<br>
I don't care if I know just where I will go<br>
Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling<br>
And rat-a-tat of my heart<br>
I think I want it to stay<br>

City of stars,<br>
Are you shinning just for me?<br>
City of stars,<br>
You never shined so brightly<br></p>

<p style="margin-top:50px;"><strong>♬ 10.	"Start a Fire"	John Legend	3:12</strong></p>
<p>[Verse 1]<br>
I don’t know why I keep moving my body<br>
I don’t know if this is wrong or if it’s right<br>
I don’t know if there’s a beat, or something’s taking over me<br>
And I just know I’ll feel so good tonight<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I don’t know what your name is but I like it<br>
I’ve been thinking ‘bout some things I wanna try<br>
I don’t know what you came to do, but I wanna do it with you<br>
And I just know I’ll feel so good tonight<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Oh, if we keep on dancing<br>
Take our rhythm to new heights<br>
Feel the heat of passion, baby<br>
Light up the night<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
We could start a fire<br>
Come on, let it burn baby<br>
We could start a fire<br>
Let the tables turn baby<br>
We could start a fire<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
I just know I feel so good<br>
Don’t you know I feel so good<br>
I just know I feel so good<br>
Tonight<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
I don’t care if this tuns into a riot<br>
Lets get reckless, tear this place down to the floor<br>
Turn the music way up loud<br>
Can’t nobody stop us now<br>
I just know I feel so good tonight<br>
I just know I feel so good tonight<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
We could start a fire<br>
Come on, let it burn baby<br>
We could start a fire<br>
Let the tables turn baby<br>
We could start a fire<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
I just know I feel so good<br>
Don’t you know I feel so good<br>
Don’t you know, don’t you know?<br>
Tonight<br></p>

<p>My aunt used to live in Paris<br>
I remember, she used to come home and tell us<br>
stories about being abroad and<br>
I remember that she told us she jumped in the river once,<br>
Barefoot<br>

She smiled,<br>
Leapt, without looking<br>
And tumble into the seine<br>
The water was freezing<br>
she spent a month sneezing<br>
but said she would do it, again<br>

Here's to the ones<br>
who dream<br>
Foolish, as they may seem<br>
Here's to the hearts<br>
that ache<br>
Here's to the mess<br>
we make<br>

She captured a feeling<br>
Sky with no ceiling<br>
Sunset inside a frame<br>
She lives in her liqour,<br>
and died with a flicker<br>
I'll always remember the flame<br>

Here's to the ones<br>
who dream<br>
Foolish, as they may seem<br>
Here's to the hearts<br>
that ache<br>
Here's to the mess<br>
we make<br>

She told me:<br>
A bit of madness is key<br>
to give us new colors to see<br>
Who knows where it will lead us?<br>

And that's why they need us,<br>
So bring on the rebels<br>
the ripples from pebbles<br>
The painters, and poets, and plays<br>

And here's to the fools<br>
who dream<br>
Crazy, as they may seem<br>
Here's to the hearts that break<br>
Here's to the mess we make<br>

I trace it all back,<br>
to that<br>
Her, and the snow, and the seine<br>
Smiling through it<br>
She said<br>
She'd do it, Again<br></p>
